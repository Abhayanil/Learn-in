# Learn-in
TimkerHub Learn in platform

A lot of the times, small communities and clubs that start in colleges become inactive because of less access to resource persons who can take sessions or get a meetup/discussion started. This is one of the main issues faced by the technology-oriented student communities. The aim of Learn{I}n programme is to enable student communities to be self-sustainable to conduct activities.
	The common scenario that we see today is students forming communities in order to learn something new. Even though they may be able to conduct few sessions on what they are aiming at, as time flies their entire growth process may get diverted and they are likely to end up the functioning of the community.
	
	The first layer of our programme is not just a mere student community, rather we are carefully filtering them based on the interest to study, basic knowledge in the domain and moreover those with the mentality to teach what they’ve acquired - More or less “ LEARN TO TEACH, TEACH TO LEARN”. We have a tracking system to ensure that everyone in the layer is sharing in the way they have been mentored.
	Our aim is to cover the entire state of Kerala. We are starting with 3 major cities- Kozhikode, Kochi, and Thiruvananthapuram. We are expecting the participation of students of different student communities from all over the state.
